# ShopSimple
ShopSimple is a mobile application that allows users to do self-shopping in the grocery. The users just need to scan the barcode of the products, add them to the cart, and pay them online. Thanks to this app, now they don't have to line up at the counter just to make a payment. The codes were done with Java, XML, Android Studio, and Firebase.
